By the time I was eight or nine,I knew what I was going to do when I grew up. I knew I was going to do something with babies. At the time I had never heard of a “Kindergarten”. When I was about eleven someone told me about a foundlings’ asylum, and I decided that a whole abuseful of babies would be the finest thing in the world, and I went so far as to ask my mother to help me to prepare myself to take charge of one when I grew up.
